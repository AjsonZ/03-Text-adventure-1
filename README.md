This is my first game! I felt exciting when I finished it.
I copy Mr.Francis game engine and it works really well.
The basic story of my game is to escape from school where are zombies everywhere.
There're eight locations: Classroom, Rooftop, the First Floor, School Gate, Playground, Heaven, Lake and Reality.
If you are in the Reality and School Gate, you win!
If you are in the Heaven, you lose. Try again!
There are many shortage in this game but this is my first try.
Hope you can enjoy the game!
